# CalculatorApp
A simple Calculator App that I made just to get used to how to use and create simple GUIs in Java, this was written in the Intellij IDE. I just wanted to make a simple calculator that uses the common mathematical functions however, I intend to expand on this version of the calculator in order to allow the option to use more complex maths.
