# CalculatorApp
A simple Calculator App that I made just to get used to how to use and create simple GUIs in Java, this was written in the Intellij IDE. I just wanted to make a simple calculator that uses the common mathematical functions however, I intend to expand on this version of the calculator in order to allow the option to use more complex maths. I intend to make it so that more complex mathematical formulae can be used such as the Newton Raphson Method - taking inspiration from other powerful online calculators such as Mathway and Symolab. This project was also to familiarise myself with GitHub and how to use GitHub correctly as I had not done so until this point.

The work in this project was made using an array of sources, particularly for the UI, as this was my first time using Swing and AWT. The remainder of the work was built using my own knowledge. I intened to take what I have learned about UI and java to build more interesting and more complicated applications in the near future, many of which I expect to feature on my Github repos.
